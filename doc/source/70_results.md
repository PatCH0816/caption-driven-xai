![The training, validation and test curves indicate low bias and low variance on the grayscale MNIST dataset (Removed correlating color feature) during the retraining of the standalone model. The real-world performance demonstrates that removing the color feature and retraining the standalone model helped to increase the model's robustness.](source/figures/performance_unbiased_with_test_fool.png "Training, validation, test and real-world curves on the grayscale MNIST dataset."){#fig:performance_unbiased_with_test_fool width=50%}
