# Closing words
This thesis describes work that took place at the Image and Video Processing Lab (IVPL) at Northwestern University in
Evanston, Illinois, from september 2022 until february 2023. I had the pleasure of meeting a manifold of people who stimulated my work and life.

I am incredibly thankful to my advisors Prof. Dr. Guido Schuster and Prof. Dr. Aggelos K. Katsaggelos, who provided me the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to write my thesis at the prestigious Northwestern University. I am also incredibly thankful to my mentor Amil Dravid, who came up with the intriguing idea for this thesis.

Thank you, Aggelos and Amil, for your invaluable guidance, confidence, constant support and enthusiasm along the way. Working with you has been a pleasure from which I profited profoundly. 

I would also like to thank Northwestern University and the Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences. The international collaboration between these two universities made this thesis possible in the first place. This is a truly great relationship full of positive impact for the involved students, professors, universities and countries.

During these last five months, I had the opportunity to attend and deepen my knowledge in two exciting courses about machine learning and optimization. As if I needed more, I had the chance to participate in seminars about MRI, human perception of AR/VR displays and around ten other fascinating seminars.

I want to thank my IVPL colleagues for creating a friendly working environment of intellectual excitement and friendship. I'm flattered that I was able to celebrate Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas with you. The ping pong and rock climbing sessions, the countless pancake brunches, sargent hall lunches and delicious dinners from different cultures around the world were the icing on the cake.

Hopefully, this thesis will provide valuable insights for other researchers into the fascinating world of explainable AI. Last but not least, the results and ideas from this thesis may inspire other researchers to create the latest and greatest achievements in this ever-evolving area of research.
