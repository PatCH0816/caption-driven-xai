# Closing words
This thesis describes work that took place at the Image and Video Processing Lab (IVPL) at the Northwestern University in
Evanston, Illinois from september 2022 until february 2023. I had the pleasure of meeting a manifold of people who stimulated my work and my life.

I am especially thankful to my advisors Prof. Dr. Guido Schuster and Prof. Dr. Aggelos K. Katsaggelos, who provided me the once in a lifetime opportunity to write my thesis at such a prestigious university in america. Special thanks to Amil Dravid, who came up with the idea for this thesis.

Thank you Aggelos  and Amil for your enthusiasm, for your invaluable guidance, for your confidence and your constant support along the way. It has been a pleasure working with you, from which I profited profoundly. 

I would also like to thank the Northwestern University and the Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences. The international collaboration between these two universities made this thesis possible in the first place.

I want to thank my IVPL colleagues for creating a congenial working environment of intellectual excitement and friendship. The ping pong and rock climbing sessions, the countless pancake brunches, sargent hall lunches and delicious dinners from different cultures around the world were the icing on the cake.

Last but not least, hopefully the results and the ideas presented in this thesis provide valuable insights for other researchers into the fascinating world of explainable AI and may inspire them to create the latest and greatest achievements in this ever evolving area of research.
