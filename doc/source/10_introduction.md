<!--- Official one page problem description -->
The number of machine learning applications is growing at a rapid pace and these models are solving complex problems in the process.

There is an increasing number of machine learning applications, which are revolutionizing the modern world. Machine learning is used to predict traffic in Google Maps, recommend Movies on Netflix, assess the situation around self driving cars, detecting spam in E-Mails, etc. 




Machine learning is everywhere

This thesis describes the development of a novel, explainable AI approach, which expresses the characteristics of a machine learning model in a text based format. Each step to obtain the final result is documented in detail in one of the following chapters:

- asdf
- sdfg
- \*@sec:closing-words contains a personal reflection of this thesis from the author's point of view.
